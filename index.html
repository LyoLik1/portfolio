      <h2>About myself</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Oleksii Nieznakomov, and I am 18 years old. I am in the
        second year of the Odessa Polytechnic, where I am actively improving my
        knowledge in the field of technical sciences, in particular, in the
        specialty "Computer Engineering". I speak English, Ukrainian and
        Russian. I am a junior front-end developer and my skills cover HTML 5,
        CSS 3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, SASS and GIT. I am
        interested in creating creative and effective websites. Outside of
        studying and programming, I stand out for my sociability and work
        approach. I believe in the importance of interaction and mutual
        assistance in a team. Willing to participate in new projects and
        training to develop my skills in the world of front-end development.
        Always open to new challenges and ready to join exciting projects. I
        believe in the power of continuous improvement and am ready to join your
        team.
